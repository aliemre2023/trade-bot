Morning Report(Trive Yatırım Menkul Değerler )
FULL THRUST AHEAD…BUT WILL INVESTORS FACE THE WRATH OF WEDNESDAY?
The100 marched a further 1.45% higher yesterday to 10,895, and peaking at 11,088, with a massive turnover of TRY 215.5bn, thanks the buoyant appetite in the Banks, followed by the Conglomerates, whereas the remaining sectors stood side-line and watched.
The Banks soared by 6.05%, led by the limit-up closing in YKBNK shares on the back of media reports regarding First Abu Dhabi Bank's potential acquisition of the Bank from KCHOL, which triggered a sector-wide buying appetite, alongside the Conglomerates, that ended the day 2.43% higher, thanks to KCHOL's 7.30% rise. The Industrials fell by 0.71%, and the Transportation stocks lost 0.32%, while the Energy stocks fell by over 1.40%. Thus, besides the Banks and the Conglomerates, not everything was rosy at the.
As most, if not all brokerage houses are singing in harmony together, expectations are for the buying momentum to continue primarily in the Banks and the Conglomerates, with the catalysts being: the expected influx of foreign hedge funds, continued ratings upgrades, relaxing of the FX swap restrictions, and removal of Türkiye from the grey list. Period.
YKBNK-KCHOL and ISCTR were yesterday's most bought30 stocks, whereas ODAS-ALARK and SASA were the most sold. It appears that ALARK's lithium battery agreement either failed to impress investors, or most like the adage, it was victim of "Buy the Rumour, Sell the News" effect.
As of print, the TRY is trading flat against both the USD and the Euro at 32.20 at 34.95, and the is also calm at 104.64.
On the commodity front, Brent is trading lower at $82.11, ahead of tonight's FOMC minutes, and GOLD has dropped to 2416.
Today, we may see the end on a negative note, as today is the last day for investors to close their credit positions as not to bear the cost of funding over the weekend, and due to the upcoming Eid break in the middle of June, we may also see the pause and catch its breather after the recent whirlwind performance.
In a meeting with high-ranking bank officials, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged German bank executives on Tuesday to step up efforts to comply with sanctions against Russia and shut down efforts to circumvent them to avoid potential penalties themselves that would cut off dollar access.

She added that the Treasury "is working to disrupt evasion wherever we see it, from Central Asia to the Caucasus and throughout Europe
