Speaking at a banking event in Amsterdam, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank is unlikely to raise its key interest rate in response to signs of stubborn inflation.

Powell added that the US economy had been "performing very well lately" but the first months of 2024 had been notable for the "lack of progress" when it came to bringing inflation down to the central bank's 2 per cent target. He stated that he expected inflation "will move back down on a monthly basis to levels that were more like the lower readings we were having last year" but "my confidence in that is not as high as it was".
